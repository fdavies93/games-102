# Games Programming 102: 2D Game Development

## Setting Up Requirements

First, make sure you have Python 3, Pip, and the venv module installed. Information on how to do this can readily be found elsewhere.

We recommend using a venv to make sure nothing else in your Python install gets broken. Go to the top level of the project in a bash terminal (probably MinGW on Windows; the standard shell on Linux / MacOS) and enter: `python3 -m venv venv`

Activate the venv:
`. ./venv/bin/activate`

Finally, install the requirements.
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
